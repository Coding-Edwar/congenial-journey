# MSIMBO Bootcamp: Project 2
## Tutorial: HTML & CSS IS HARD
### This tutorial covered the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

It was very useful in helping me become more familiar with the basics of web development. 
For me, it provided clarity being able to test code in my editor via a local live-server. To see the changes I was making to the code being rendered on the browser motivates me to gain deeper level of understanding of what I'd be able do as professional developer. 

It gave me more practice in putting together mutiple files to deliver a well organized project. As well as, taking consideration about adhering to a work-flow style suitable for me. I used VS Code, the class recommended editor, to create all of the file as suggested. Also, creating a branch for every chapter along the way has been crucial in conceptializing all of the different collaborators it takes to deliver a project on time. 

I read through and downloaded the files from the tutorial at ***[html & css is hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/)***. It was a fun learning experience that I will build on.
